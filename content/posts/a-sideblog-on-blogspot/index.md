I've been somewhat mute here lately and haven't updated my GitHub Pages in a while. However, I've been actively engaged in research and taking notes on a new [sideblog on Blogspot](https://hexagr.blogspot.com).


So, I've been writing a little Rust, Python, and C# code, [exploring](https://hexagr.blogspot.com/2023/08/portable-executable-format-and.html) [operating system internals](https://hexagr.blogspot.com/2023/08/windows-process-initialization.html). And [utilizing aspects of .NET to do stuff on Windows](https://hexagram.foo/posts/using-c-sharp-to-enumerate-windows-processes/). And occasionally, I've been [analyzing malware](https://hexagr.blogspot.com/2023/01/mm-malware-analysis.html).
